## Submission Requirements
- Must print only `ඞ amogus`
  - Newlines are allowed and prefered, however, keep it to one please.
- Should be named `ඞ.<extension>`
  - I.E, `ඞ.py, ඞ.rs, ඞ.c, etc`
- Joke submissions should go in the `joke` folder of the language.
  - I.E: Twisting of the rules.
    - Scripts that print `ඞ amogus` `x` amount of times.
- miscellaneous submissions should go in the `misc` folder.
  - I.E: Non-programming languages.
    - Files such as `JPG`, `PNG`, `TXT`, etc.
- Non-joke submissions should go in its own folder in the `lang` folder.
  - I.E: `lang/CSharp/ඞ.cs`
    - Each language will have a subfolder for miscellaneous and joke submission then they are created. Example tree listing below.
      ```
      Assembly
      ├── joke
      │   ├── ඞ_420.asm
      │   └── ඞ_69.asm
      ├── misc
      │   └── ඞ_boot.asm
      └── ඞ.asm
      ```
    - Add a `NOTES.md` with any notes and the tree if possible. Example below.
      ```md
      # Langname
      ## Notes
      - Note 1
      - Note 2
      ## Tree
      Langname
      ├── joke
      │   ├── ඞ_420.langext
      │   └── ඞ_69.langext
      ├── misc
      │   └── ඞ_boot.langext
      └── ඞ.langext
      ```
      - If you have no notes, exclude the notes section.
      - Please put the tree in a code block.
  - **Any language that is, at the very least, usable to print a string.**

We will request changes on your submission if: 
- These conditions aren't met.
- We find it's not suitable for the repository in its current state.

**If your submission is offensive in any way, it will be denied on sight, without hesitation.**

**As these files are basically just "Hello, world!" but for "ඞ amogus", all contributions will be licensed under the "[Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)" license. If you do not like this, then do not contribute. This may be subject to change.**
